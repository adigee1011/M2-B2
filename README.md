Class 2 - Prompt 201


* Describe one thing you're learning in class today.

We learnt about If conditional statements today and build Rock-Paper-Scissors game with it.

* What is the difference between == and === ?

== is used to compare two variables in a non strict mode I.e. 2 and ‘2’ would be true even though 2 is a number and ‘2’ is a string but ‘2’ would get typecast into the number before comparing

=== is a strict mode where 2 and ‘2’ would be false as they are different data types

* What is the value of foo? var foo = 10 + '20';

1020

* Describe what a terminal application is.

Terminal is a command line interface of the computer where a user can interact with the computer without using graphical user interface that they are generally comfortable with

* What is the ternary operator?
The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.

1.   Listen to Your Users
Take the time to ask your regular visitors what they’d like to see on your page. 
2.   Speed It Up
Web users expect your site to load at lightning speed, even on mobile devices. 
3.   Provide In-Depth Information
When a site visitor lands on your page, they want to get the information they need to make an informed decision about your product or service. If the visitor has to hunt for this information, they may assume you’re hiding something or grow frustrated and leave for a competitor’s website. The more in-depth and accessible you can make information on what you have to offer, the better.
4.   Make Navigation Intuitive
When a visitor lands on a website, they often look to the navigation bar to orient themselves with the page. The navigation bar is essential because it follows the site visitor throughout their journey on your site and serves as a tool to go back to the landing page.
5.   Choose Color Carefully
Choose the colors for your website carefully. You need a perfect balance between beauty and clarity. Not only does your color palette need to make sense for your industry, but the contrast between the background and text needs to be enough that the visitor can read text easily and not strain the eyes.
6.   Improve Your Site Layout
Keep in mind that many users are now accessing websites via mobile devices. 

* What are your favorite features of HTML5, and how have you implemented them in your front-end development projects?

One feature that stands out for me is GRID layout
The second one is media queries

* How do you structure your CSS and JavaScript to make it easier for other developers to work with?

Couple of points:

Separation of Concern  
Have.CSS and Javascript in two separate files instead of combining it in one file
CSS should be used for design and Javascript should be used for interacting with the webpage 

Comments for the code is equally important for both CSS and Javascript.

* What's your process for addressing browser-specific rendering problems? Do you find that a certain browser is more challenging to work with than others?

We have only Chrome in the class but in my experience with my job I have found IE to be a challenging browser for developers as a lot of things are not supported on that.
